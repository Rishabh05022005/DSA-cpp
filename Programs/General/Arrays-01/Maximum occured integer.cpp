/*Given n integer ranges, the task is to find the maximum occurring 
integer in these ranges. If more than one such integer exits, 
find the smallest one. The ranges are given as two arrays L[] and R[].  
L[i] consists of starting point of range and R[i] consists of corresponding    //error
end point of the range.*/
